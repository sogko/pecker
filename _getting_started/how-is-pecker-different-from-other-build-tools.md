Well, for one thing, Pecker is **not** a build tool.

Pecker is not looking to do what Grunt, Gulp or Broccoli head out to do. 

### It is a framework
Pecker is a **framework that aims to make your assets management easier**, using multitude of tools behind the scene to achieve that.

In fact, currently Pecker is using Gulp as a build tool as part of the framework. It was selected because right now, it seems to fit most of the use-cases we needed.

### Why a framework?
The beauty of this is that we help to figure out the best tools and practices that you might need, free-ing you with making other choices related to other parts of your application development.

We also try to ensure that Pecker would play nice with other web technologies. At the end of the day, we want to help you achieve productivity, not hinder it.

*(Heck, if Broccoli turns out to be a better build tool, Pecker might use it to some capacity.)*
